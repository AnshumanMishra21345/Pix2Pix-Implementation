# Pix2Pix Implementation

## Overview
This repository is part of the IIT Madras AI Club Deputy Coordinator Mini Project that aims at reimplementing the **Pix2Pix** paper. The project follows a structured week-wise approach, covering both **theoretical concepts** and **practical implementations** of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and **Conditional GANs (cGANs)**.

## Objectives
- Develop a step-by-step understanding of the Pix2Pix model.
- Explore the theoretical foundations of GANs and cGANs.
- Gain hands-on experience with machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## About Pix2Pix
The **Pix2Pix** model, introduced in *"Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks"* by Isola et al., is a supervised deep learning method designed for various image-to-image translation tasks. It employs a **U-Net-based generator** and a **PatchGAN discriminator**, trained with adversarial and L1 losses.

## Getting Started
To follow along with the course structure, navigate through the respective week folders and explore both the theoretical notes and code implementations.
